## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am Anna and I am currently a PhD Computer Science student specializing in Data Science at NYIT.

I have an interest in data and machine learning problems 

I enjoy researching new ways to apply formulas to data to get additional insights that weren't previously found by common methods.

The majority of the projects are ones I completed after finishing a master's in Computer Science and are written primarily in Python and SQL.

âš¡ See below for the languages/Tools I use in Analytics:
      SQL
      Python
      Tableau 
      Excel
      MS Access

I'm working on creating and adding new features to dashboards on public Tableau.
So, I have a couple dashboards published.
